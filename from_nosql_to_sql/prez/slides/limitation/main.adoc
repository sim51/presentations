== Is there a trap ?

=== Some limitations

[.step]
* No WRITE operation (for now)
* No help on PG planner when doing JOIN on other table
* Cypher query must return a collection (with alias)
* Postgres do all mathematical et aggregation operation !


=== Reduce the amount of fetched data

Where clauses are pushed to Neo4j

* equality, inequality (=, <>, >, <, ⇐, >=)
* like, ilike and their negations

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * FROM neo4j_movie WHERE movie LIKE 'Matr%';

MATCH (n:Movie) WITH  n.title as movie WHERE movie=~'Matr.*';
----
