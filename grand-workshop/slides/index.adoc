== Focus on Neo4j

=== Neo4j

image::assets/neo4j.png[]

http://www.neo4j.com/developper

=== Neo4j is a database

image::assets/neo4j-database.png[]

=== Neo4j is a native graph database

image::assets/neo4j-graph-database.png[]

=== A graph of properties

==== !

image::assets/graph1.png[]

==== !

**Nodes**

* The entity of your model
* Can have labels
* Can have properties


**Relationships**

* Links two nodes, with a **direction** and a **type**
* Can have properties

=== A local approach

==== !

image::assets/whiteboard.png[]

==== !

=== Cypher

**OpenCypher.org**

Aims to deliver a full and open specification of the industry's most widely adopted graph database query langage.

=== Ascii Art : Node

* **`()` or `(n)`**
** Surrounded with parentheses
** Use an alias to refer to our node later


* **`(n:Label1:Label2)`**
** Specify a Label, starts with a  colon `:`
** Group nodes by roles or types, think of labels as tags


* **`(n:Label {prop: 'value'})`**
** Nodes can have properties

=== Ascii Art : Relationship

* **`-->` or `-[r:TYPE]->`**
** Wrapped with hyphens & square brackets
** Like labels, a relationship type starts with a colon `:`


* **`<` `>` Specify the direction of the relationship `-[:KNOWS {since: 2010}]->`**
** Relationships can have properties too!

=== Exercice 1

**Goal: Query for Movie by title and find recommended movies**

* Sign in to Neo4j Sandbox: neo4jsandbox.com
* Create a “Recommendations” sandbox
* Explore the data in Neo4j Browser
* Write two Cypher queries:
* Search for a Movie by title substring
* For a given movie, find recommended movies
** __Hint: explore the browser guide for ideas__
** _Save these queries, we’ll use them in the next exercise_

__For those that want to do it locally, you can download the dataset here : TODO
And use `:play https://guides.neo4j.com/sandbox/recommendations/index.html` to launch the guide__

=== Answer

* Search for a Movie by title substring

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (movie:Movie) WHERE toLower(movie.title) CONTAINS toLower($subString) RETURN movie LIMIT $limit;
----

* For a given movie, find recommended movies

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)-[:IN_GENRE]->(:Genre)<-[:IN_GENRE]-(movie:Movie)
WHERE m.movieId= $movieIds
WITH m, movie, COUNT(*) AS genreOverlap

  MATCH (m)<-[:RATED]-(:User)-[:RATED]->(movie)
  WITH movie, genreOverlap, COUNT(*) AS userRatedScore
  RETURN movie
  ORDER BY
    (0.9 * genreOverlap) + (0.1 * userRatedScore)
    DESC
  LIMIT 3
----

== Focus on GraphQL

=== A large adoption

image::assets/graphql-adoption.png[]

=== What is GraphQl

**“A query language for your API”**

* Developed by Facebook iOS team for iOS app
** Reduce number of round trip requests in face of low latency
* Declarative, state what fields you want
Alternative to REST
Self documenting (schema and types)
Limited support for “queries”
Logic is implemented in server

=== GraphQL

==== !

* “A query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data”

* “GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine”

* “A GraphQL service is created by defining types and fields on those types, then providing resolver functions for each field on each type”

query($id:ID = 2571) {
  Movie(movieId:$id) {
    movieId
    title
    plot
    poster

    genres{
      name
    }
    directors {

=== GraphQl First Development

==== !

image::assets/graphql-first-dev.png[]

==== !

Schema is your friend, and GraphQl schema is the API spec

* **Design API schema**
* **Build UI and backend**
* **Deploy !**

=== Schema Definition Language

https://wehavefaces.net/graphql-shorthand-notation-cheatsheet-17cd715861b6[GraphQL Cheat Sheet]

* **Type :** The graph model definition
* **Query :** What queries you can do
* **Mutations :** What changes you can do

=== Type

==== Movie

[source,javascript]
----
type Movie {
  movieId: ID!
  title: String
  released: Int
  plot: String
  poster: String
  imdbRating: Float
  actors: [Actor]
  recommendations(skip: Int = 0, limit: Int = 5): [Movie]
}
----

==== Actor

[source,javascript]
----
interface Person {
  name: ID!
}

type Actor implements Person {
  name: ID!
  actedIn(skip: Int = 0, limit: Int = 5): [Movie]
}
----

=== Queries / Mutation

==== Movie

[source,javascript]
----
type Query {
  movieById(movieId: ID!): Movie
  movieSearch(search: String = "", skip: Int = 0, limit: Int = 10): [Movie]
}

type Mutation {
  movieMerge(movieId: ID, title: String!, actors:[String], ...): Movie
}
----

==== Actor

[source,javascript]
----
type Query {
  actorById(id: ID!): Actor
  actorSearch(search:String!): [Actor]
}

type Mutation {
  actorMerge(name:String!): Actor
}
----

=== API Workflow

image::assets/graphql-api-workflow.png[height=800]

== Apollo

=== Resolvers

**How to fetch the data**

[source,javascript]
----
Movie {

  recommendations: async ( current, _, context ) => {
    let result = await Neo4j.run( context.driver.session(), queries.RECO, current, Neo4j.mappingNodeN );
    return result;
  }

},

Query: {

  movieById( root, params, context, resolveInfo ) {
    let result = await Neo4j.run( context.driver.session(), queries.GET, params, Neo4j.mappingNodeN );
    return result;
  },

  movieSearch: async ( root, params, context, resolveInfo  ) => {
    let session = context.driver.session();
    let query = "MATCH (movie:Movie) WHERE movie.title CONTAINS $search RETURN movie LIMIT $first;"
    return session.run(query, params)
      .then( result => { return result.records.map(record => { return record.get("movie").properties })})
  },

}

=== Apollo Launchpad

https://launchpad.graphql.com/3x984k8mv

image::assets/apollo-lauchpad.png[height=800]

=== GraphQl Server

Just an express.js server with some custom endpoints.

[source,javascript]
----
import express from 'express';
import { graphqlExpress, graphiqlExpress } from 'apollo-server-express';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';

const PORT = 3000;
const server = express();

/**
 * GraphQL endpoint
 */
server.use( '/graphql', bodyParser.json(), graphqlExpress( async ( request ) => {  return {
  // your graphql schema
  schema: schema,
  // some context for the endpoint (here the Neo4j driver)
  context: Neo4j.context( request.headers, process.env )
}}));

/**
 * Create the graphiql endpoint.
 */
server.use( '/graphiql', graphiqlExpress( { endpointURL: '/graphql', query:'' }));

/**
 * Run the server.
 */
server.listen( PORT, () => { console.log( `GraphQL Server is now running on http://localhost:${PORT}/graphql` ) } );
----

=== GraphQl Server - II

[source,javascript]
----
/**
 * Enable CORS + OPTIONS request for the graphql endpoint.
 */
server.use(
  '/graphql',
  ( req, res, next ) => {
    res.header( 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', true );
    res.header( 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'content-type, authorization, content-length, x-requested-with, accept, origin' );
    res.header( 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST, GET, OPTIONS' );
    res.header( 'Allow', 'POST, GET, OPTIONS' );
    res.header( 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*' );

    if ( req.method === 'OPTIONS' ) {
      res.sendStatus( 200 );
    } else {
      next();
    }
  }
);
----

=== Use The Schema, Luke

http://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql-js[neo4j-graphql-js] & https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql[neo4j-graphql plugin]

Translate your schema directly in Cypher, thanks to drirectives.

=== Exercice 2

**Goal: Build a GraphQL service that connects to Neo4j, allow for querying movies and recommended movies via GraphQL**

* Start with skeleton Launchpad: launchpad.graphql.com/3x984k8mv
* Fork it, then add your Neo4j Sandbox credentials to secrets
* Complete the GraphQL service implementation by adding your Cypher queries from Exercise 1
* [optional] Use the JS GraphQL→ Cypher integrations instead of Cypher in resolver functions.

=== Exercice 2 : answer

https://launchpad.graphql.com/x57134qwl

__Note the GraphQl endpoint, we will use it later__

== Focus on React

=== Everything is component

image::app-react.png[]

=== React Apollo : client

https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo

Create an Apollo client by providing the GraphQl endpoint

[source,javascript]
----
import { ApolloClient } from 'apollo-boost';

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://mpjk0plp9.lp.gql.zone/graphql',
});
----

=== React Apollo : wrap application

Wrap your react application with `ApolloProvider`

[source,javascript]
----
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { ApolloProvider } from 'react-apollo';

const WrappedApp = (
  <ApolloProvider client={client}>
    <App />
  </ApolloProvider>
);

render(WrappedApp, document.getElementById('root'));
----

=== React Apollo : component

====!

[source,javascript]
----
import {Component} from "react";
import gql from "graphql-tag";
import { graphql} from "react-apollo";

class MovieList extends Component {

  render() {
    const {data} = this.props;
    if (data.loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
    if (data.movies.length === 0) return <div>No movies!</div>;

    ...

  }
}

export default graphql(gql`${GRAPHQL_QUERY}`)(MovieList);
----

====!

* Using React’s Higher Order Component feature : we can populate a component’s props to a GraphQL query
* graphql() enhancer function
* Now whenever TodoApp component is rendered, the GraphQL query is executed

=== React Apollo : Use the query component

[source,javascript]
----
import {Component} from "react";
import gql from "graphql-tag";
import { Query } from "react-apollo";

class MovieList extends Component {

  render() {
    <Query query={GRAPHQL_QUERY}>
      {
        ({ loading, data: { movies } }) => {
          if (loading)  return <div>loading....</div>
          if (movies.length === 0) return <div>No movies!</div>;

          ...
        }
      }
    </Query>
  }
}

export default MovieList;
----

=== Codesandbox

https://codesandbox.io/s/pk4219zyp0

image::app-codesandbox.png[]

=== Exercice 3

**Goal: Complete the skeleton React app by adding Apollo Client and fetch data from the GraphQL API you created in Exercise #2**

* Start with skeleton CodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/pk4219zyp0
* Fork it
* Complete the app by adding Apollo Client as a higher order component and connecting to your GraphQL API, using GraphQL to render movie data and recommendations

* See: https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo
* You’ll need to add react-apollo and apollo-client NPM dependencies
